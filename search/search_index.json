In order to estimate the size of the entire peptidome search space in relation to the total of potential MHCI peptides in the human genome we created a custom total translation of the human genome into octapeptides. To get a better grip on exploration of this human octapeptidome space, or all the genomic encoded octapeptides we performed an in silico translation for the reference human genome GRCh38. Hypothetically all of these octapeptides can be transcribed and translated as the recent discoveries in the field of of non-canonical translation drastically increased the amount of potential peptides being expressed and discovered in the MHCI peptidome. These cryptic MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences.1 Most sequences in sequence space presumably have no function, leaving relatively small regions that are populated by naturally occurring genes. However the absence of a function may also be an interesting feature if the presumably functionless peptide encoded in the genome is expressed under upset or unusual conditions and sufficiently high enough to processed in the immune system. A typical estimate of the size of entire peptidome sequence space is 20E100 (approx. 10E130) for a protein of 100 amino acids in which any of the normally occurring 20 amino acids can be found. MHCI is restricting our search to a defined length for peptides to 8 amino acids we will limit our calculations to peptides of 8 aa or simply 24 Nucleotides. For simplicity we also ignore post translational modifications and only assume the 20 amino acids used in normal translation. The total number of possible peptides for this octapeptidome is 20E8 = 25.600.000.000 octapeptides. This number of 25.6 billion octapeptides is referred to a the total octapeptidome. For the human genome we have determined the total number of possible peptides by using the latest update of GRCh38.p14: 3.634.521.541 unique octapeptides are generated by insilico translation of all possible reading frames and strands. For GRCh38 the number of \"attempted\" octapeptide translations per DNA sequence is calculated as following: length of sequence - (8 codons * 3 bp/codon) + 1 There are 639 sequences given in GRCh38. Calculating with the above formula for each gives 3.272.074.508 theoretical octapeptide sequences population the human octapetidome. Actual generated: 3.272.074.508 Unique sequences generated: 1.955.004.643 Unique \"peptides\" (sequences matching only 20aa + Selenocysteine): 1.241.124.045 1.241.124.045 / 3.272.074.508 ~= 0.379 ~= 37% coverage of maximum possible coverage 1.241.124.045 / 25.600.000.000 ~= 0.048 ~= 4.84% coverage of all possible sequences Total peptides: 2.031.284.512 Other sequences (mismatches): 713.880.598 ? Checksum: 713.880.598 + 1.241.124.045 = 1.955.004.643 The most frequent peptide was KKKKKKKK with 275208.

We open each sequence, translate the first 24bp using Biopython's translate function, record the result, then increment the position in the sequence by one. That means we also record those with stop codons or ambiguous translations. I also count them, which given the way I'm doing it also means sorting them alphabetically. After sorting and counting, we separate them by doing a search that allows only for the 21 amino acids. Here are the first 10 matches (alphabetically): AAAAAAAA 4697 AAAAAAAC 37 AAAAAAAD 71 AAAAAAAE 153 AAAAAAAF 45 AAAAAAAG 521 AAAAAAAH 30 AAAAAAAI 52 AAAAAAAK 56 AAAAAAAL 169 If we count the number of these unique \"matches\" I get 1241124045. All others are \"mismatches\". Here are the first 10 mismatches alphabetically. &&&&&&& 16802 &&&&&&&A 133 &&&&&&A& 6 &&&&&A&& 1 &&&A&&&& 1 &&A&&&&& 6 &A&&&&&& 8 A&&&&&&& 48 &&&&&&AA 4 &&&&&A&A 1 The & is the symbol for any stop codon. (If we wanted to, we could distinguish between stop codons.) So there were 16802 cases found of 8 consecutive stop codons. The total number of unique mismatches is 713.880.598. Stop codons, also known as termination codons, are nucleotide triplets that signal the end of a protein-coding sequence in the messenger RNA (mRNA). The presence of eight consecutive stop codons in the human genome appears to us as a highly unusual occurrence, as the typical protein-coding gene has only one stop codon at the end of its coding sequence. It is possible that the presence of eight consecutive stop codons could be a result of sequencing errors or artifacts, rather than a genuine biological feature. However, assuming that they are real, there are several potential explanations for their presence: 1 Regulatory element: It is possible that these stop codons are part of a regulatory element that controls gene expression. For example, they could be involved in the processing of the mRNA transcript or in the regulation of translation. 2 Untranslated region: Another possibility is that the eight consecutive stop codons are located in the untranslated region (UTR) of a gene, rather than the coding region. The UTR is important for controlling mRNA stability and translation efficiency, and it is possible that the stop codons play a role in these processes. 3 Non-coding RNA: The eight consecutive stop codons could also be part of a non-coding RNA molecule, rather than a protein-coding gene. Non-coding RNAs are known to play important roles in gene regulation, and it is possible that the stop codons are involved in the processing or function of the RNA molecule. 4 Pseudogene: Finally, it is possible that the eight consecutive stop codons are located in a pseudogene, which is a non-functional copy of a gene that has accumulated mutations over time. Pseudogenes are thought to make up a significant proportion of the human genome, and some of them may contain multiple stop codons. Overall, without more specific information about the location and context of the eight consecutive stop codons, it is difficult to speculate on their precise function. However, it is clear that they represent a highly unusual and potentially interesting feature of the human genome.","title":"The size of the octapeptidome space"},{"location":"contents/The%20story%20of%20antisense%20proteins/","text":"Antisense proteins are defined by the opposite DNA strand they originate from, they are; until now mainly described for viral, canonical genes.

This results in the notion that, particularly in upset conditions like cancer, stress or viral infections, there is a possibility that not only antisense genes are transcribed and translated but also random antisense transcripts start to appear, accumulate and contribute to the appearance of novel antigens triggering an immune response.

The role of ghost proteins in the immune system is not well understood, and there is still much research being done to determine their exact function.

Arthur Kroon Version 20230212 Introduction The acquisition of the DNA sequence of human genome was a landmark in biotechnology in 2001.1 However, after over 20 years for the analysis and application of the human genome information in clinical settings still we have many riddles to unravel. Limitations research tools for gene transcription, translation and the bioinformatics to assess exactly how DNA sequences are transcribed, translated and affect the phenotype obstructed the optimal use of genome sequences. In addition there still are many poorly understood aspects of processing of peptides and proteins which hamper the true applicability of the human genome sequence information. For many diseases the associated immunology is a key field to understand better. However, the comprehensive analysis of the immunopeptidome, a critical component for understanding the immune system, still lags behind the genomic information. In this review the immunopeptidome is defined as the set of peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI) molecules. Exact knowledge of the role of the immunopeptidome in health and disease, in relation to the genome information, can directly fuel and guide the development of next-generation vaccines, novel cell therapies and immunotherapies against autoimmunity, infectious diseases and cancers. Especially the part of the immunopeptidome comprising the MHCI antigenic peptides has been an intense area of research the last decade due to the new possibilities of high throughput ribosome profiling, mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing allowing to investigate translation in an unbiased manner. Although the immunopeptidome and especially the MHCI peptides can be derived from the degradation of proteins that are present in a cell, they can also be generated directly by transcription and translation of short regions within the cellular transcriptome. This process, called non canonical translation, involves the transcription of a short stretch of DNA and translation of that short stretch of RNA into a short peptide, which is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and loaded onto an MHC molecule. The MHC-peptide complex is then transported to the surface of the cell, where it can be recognized by T cells. This process allows T cells to recognize and respond to specific proteins that are being produced within a cell, rather than just those that are present as degradation products. It has proven to be an important mechanism for the immune system to monitor the activity of cells and to identify and respond to cells that are producing abnormal or potentially harmful proteins (REFS). In this review we explore the field of so-called non-canonical translation products in relation to disease and immunological processes. The human genome with its 3 billion base pairs has a large capacity of potential translation products and only part of the coding capacity seems to be explored with respect to the role of non-canonical translation. What is the total number of peptides if take into account all reading frames on both strands and directions? Which ones are transcribed and expressed? How do cells deal with translational \u201cnoise\u201d. i.e. nonsense (m)RNA\u2019s and their subsequent translation? Which peptides are recognized and selected in the immune system? Is only a small subset of the total genome functionally expressed or are there large amounts of open reading frames present but never expressed ? At least according the classical meaning of expression in terms of an biochemical activity or is a subset of peptides mainly important for immunological processes? Potentially immunogenic alternative open reading frame products can be discovered under different names in literature. The list of similar or overlapping terms coined to refer to these peptides is long and due to the relative freshness of the observations the list is getting long and somewhat confusing. In this review will provide a framework to classify the different types of orfs and their translation products. We also describe the mechanistic background of these non-canonical orf\u2019s or alternative orf\u2019s. In various paragraphs we will deal in a chronological overview with the first discovery of alternative Open Reading Frame products (altORF) or the many related terms: Peptons, Neoantigens, Micropeptides, Small Open Reading Frame (smORF), Cryptic peptides, Defective ribosomal initiation products (DRiP), Non-canonical translation products, micro Open Reading Frame (mORF), non-canonical HLA-binding peptides (noncHLAp), antisense proteins, ghost proteins. These proteins and peptides can be generated by a variety of separate mechanisms for example by both programmed and non-programmed frameshifting, internal ribosome entry sites, and repeat associated non ATG translation. The summary of the various terms and classification of several types of non-canonical translation mechanisms may be helpful to design better diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. The story of PAMPs and DAMPs: What\u2019s the difference? PAMP stands for \"pathogen-associated molecular pattern.\" It is a molecule that is associated with a pathogen and is recognized by the host's immune system. PAMPs are typically found on the surface of pathogens, and they are used by the immune system to identify the presence of an invading pathogen. DAMP stands for \"damage-associated molecular pattern.\" It is a molecule that is released by damaged cells in response to injury or stress. DAMPs are recognized by the immune system and can trigger an immune response. They are involved in the body's natural response to injury or tissue damage, and they play a role in the inflammatory response. Both PAMPs and DAMPs are important for the immune system to function properly. PAMPs help the immune system to recognize and respond to pathogens, while DAMPs help the immune system to recognize and respond to tissue damage or injury.PAMPS and DAMPS are a special class of immunomodulation molecules. PAMPs are molecules derived from microorganisms and thus drive inflammation in response to infections. One well-known PAMP is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is found on the outer cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. DAMPs are immune response modulating molecules derived from host cells, including tumor cells, dead or dying cells, or products released from cells in response to signals such as hypoxia or stress.6 Because DAMP\u2019s are derived from host materials, DAMPs can induce what\u2019s known as sterile inflammatory responses where no infection is involved in triggering the inflammatory responses. DAMPs are intracellularly sequestered molecules that remain unrecognized by the immune system under normal physiological conditions. In this review neoepitopes are not considered as a special class of DAMP\u2019s because neoepitopes are de novo generated in abnormal physiological conditions like infection, cancer or stress. Neoantigens due to the presentation by MHCI molecules are thus a class of molecules that must be separated from DAMP\u2019s. The story of Nested alternate open reading frames Nested alternate open reading frames (nested AORFs) are a type of genetic sequence that can encode multiple proteins from a single gene. They are called \"nested\" because the open reading frames (ORFs) are located within one another, and \"alternate\" because they can produce different proteins depending on which ORF is used for translation. These sequences are thought to play a role in gene regulation and protein diversity, and have been found in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. In a nested AORF, multiple ORFs are found within a single gene, and each ORF can potentially be transcribed and translated into a different protein. The use of nested AORFs is thought to be an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and producing protein diversity. For example, the use of different ORFs within a single gene can allow for the production of multiple proteins with different functions or regulatory roles. Additionally, the choice of which ORF is used for translation can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of specific regulatory elements or the availability of certain proteins or small RNA molecules. One notable example of nested AORFs is the N-Myc gene in mammals. This gene has multiple ORFs that can produce proteins with different functions, including NCYM, a cis antisense encoded factor that regulates the expression of other genes.12 Mutations in the N-Myc gene have been associated with various types of cancer, and the use of different ORFs within the gene has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of these diseases. The story of microproteins Roughly 25,000 genes code for biologically relevant proteins, most of which are large chains of 300 or more linked amino acids. But, increasingly, \u201cmicroproteins,\u201d with fewer than 100 amino acids, are being found to have important roles in health and disease. Despite their small size, microproteins play important roles in a variety of biological processes, including gene regulation, cell signaling, and protein folding.

This can be leveraged when human microproteins translated from noncanonical ORFs are used to look for evolutionary birth events. More specifically, to identify and examine cases in the human lineage of small proteins that evolved out of previously noncoding sequences and acquired function either immediately or shortly thereafter. This is doubly important: for our understanding of the intriguing, and still largely mysterious phenomenon of de novo gene birth, but also for our appreciation of the full functional potential of the human genome and finding out is the MHCI class of peptides can be connected to the microproteins. The story of non-canonical protein expression Up to 2014 non-canonical translation was deemed insignificant and marginally important for biotechnological applications. But the introduction of ribosome profiling in combination with next generation sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry advances provided convincing evidence and opened up a higher interest into research on the role of small and non-canonical ORF\u2019s in biology.

Non-canonical MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences.

These MHCI peptides are derived from the degradation of proteins within the cell, and they are typically generated through the action of proteasomes, which are responsible for breaking down proteins into smaller peptides.

The story of antisense proteins Antisense proteins are defined by the opposite DNA strand they originate from, they are; until now mainly described for viral, canonical genes. From the time of their discovery, it was thought that retroviruses encoded proteins on only one strand of proviral DNA. However, in 1988, it was predicted that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and other retroviruses, express an antisense protein encoded on the DNA strand opposite that encoding the known viral proteins.14 Since most genomes has been proven to be riddled with retroviral remnants and transposons we assume that this mechanism of antisense proteins being expressed and functional may also be valid for cellular transcription and translation.

The story of cryptic peptides Cryptic peptides are referring to a diverse group of peptides which come to existence by probably various mechanisms. In this review we investigate the literature considering the cryptic peptide in reference to their role in the Immune system. Cytolytic T cells eliminate infected or cancer cells by recognizing peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. The antigenic peptides are derived primarily from newly synthesized proteins including those produced by cryptic translation mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that cryptic translation can be initiated by distinct mechanisms at non-AUG codons in addition to conventional translation initiated at the canonical AUG start codon. The dark proteome and MHCI class peptides The dark proteome refers to the vast majority of proteins in an organism that are not easily detected using standard techniques such as mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis. These proteins may be present at low levels, may be highly dynamic or transient, or may have structural properties that make them difficult to detect. Despite their elusive nature, the dark proteome is thought to play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling, immune defense, and metabolism. One class of proteins that has garnered particular interest within the context of the dark proteome is the MHC class I (MHCI) peptides. MHCI proteins are integral components of the immune system, playing a critical role in the recognition and presentation of foreign or abnormal proteins to immune cells. MHCI proteins are expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells and present short peptides, derived from inside the cell, to T cells, which can then mount an immune response if the peptides are deemed to be a threat. However, the vast majority of MHCI peptides are derived from the dark proteome, rather than from known proteins or protein-coding genes. This has led to the hypothesis that the dark proteome may play a significant role in immune surveillance and defense. For example, it is thought that the MHCI pathway may allow cells to present and target proteins that are produced by viruses or other pathogens, helping to protect the organism from infection. There is also evidence that MHCI peptides derived from the dark proteome may be involved in other biological processes beyond immune defense. For example, some studies have suggested that MHCI peptides may play a role in the regulation of gene expression, or may be involved in the development and function of the nervous system. Despite the potential importance of the dark proteome and MHCI peptides, there is still much that is unknown about these proteins and their roles in biology. Advances in technologies such as mass spectrometry and proteomics are helping to shed light on the dark proteome and its role in health and disease, but much work remains to be done to fully understand this part of the proteome. The mechanisms of translation Classic translation theory: one gene one protein Canonical translation has traditionally been divided into four stages: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. In the first three of these stages mechanisms resulting in non-canonical translation events have been described. Besides alternative start codons, processes like leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry and repeat associated non-ATG translation result in alternative reading frame proteins and peptides. During elongation both programmed and non-programmed frameshift events result in the translation of alternative reading frames into peptides. The story of immunoribosomes Ribosomes are universally important in biology and their production is dysregulated by developmental disorders, cancer, and virus infection. The concept of specialized ribosomes, immunoribosomes, was proposed to supported the DRiP hypothesis.15 Immunoribosomes are supposed to explain the kinetic observations of early appearance of viral immune responses while viral proteins are inherently stable and retirees or degradation products seem unlikely source to rely on for a timely immune system activation. Till this moment immunoribosomes have yet to be identified and characterized, no clear evidence has been presented for their existence. Frameshifting; a tale of slippery sequences.

AltORFs can originate from a diverse array of mechanisms. For example near cognate start codons can create alternative translation initiation sites initiating protein synthesis at a different location than the main ORF. Alternative ORFs are often found in the non-coding regions of a genome, and their expression may be regulated differently than the main ORF. Alternative ORFs are important because they can give rise to either diverse protein isoforms, or totally different proteins which can have different functions in the cell. For example, alternative ORFs may produce proteins with different amino acid sequences, post-translational modifications, or subcellular localization. Alternative ORFs may also play a role in gene expression regulation, as they can be subject to different transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. Several methods have been developed to identify alternative ORFs, including computational analysis of genomic sequences, ribosome profiling which involves high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments. These approaches have revealed that alternative ORFs are more common than previously thought, and they may contribute to the diversity and complexity of proteomes in various organisms. In summary, alternative ORFs are sequences in DNA or RNA that can be translated into proteins, and they may give rise to diverse protein isoforms with different functions. They are important in gene expression regulation and proteome diversity, and their identification has been facilitated by various computational and experimental techniques. Many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain, in addition to a reference open reading frame (ORF), unconventional alternative open reading frames (altORF). Here, altORFs are defined as potential protein-coding ORFs in ncRNAs, in UTRs or in different reading frames from annotated CDSs in mRNAs (Figure 1a). For clarity, predicted proteins translated from altORFs are termed alternative proteins (altPROT\u2019s) and proteins translated from annotated CDSs are termed reference proteins.7 The processes ( scan trough, read through, an internal ribosome entry) inducing AltProt synthesis can be associated with translation stress e.g. due to infection, oncogenesis or unknown factors affecting ribosomal function and performance. Figuur 1 from samandi et al. 8 The additional coding sequences can vary in size from few, below 100 (small open reading frames; sORFs), to several hundred codons and can be located upstream, downstream or even overlapping with the reference ORF.9 Translation of these altORFs occurs from different translation initiation sites and may happen in a different reading frame as the reference ORF. The presence of small open reading frames is not restricted to mRNA but has been also described for other regulatory RNAs which were formerly believed to be non-coding (ncRNA, (Nam et al., 2016)). A number of long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to encode for and extensively translate small peptides.10 11 A translatable ORF is typically recognized as the coding DNA sequence (CDS) on an mRNA that gives rise to its principle protein product. sORFs are distinguished from all other ORFs by their sizes, but not all sORFs are translated or are indeed translatable. Translatable sORFs have been found within the 5\u0374 leader and 3\u0374 trailer sequences, within or overlapping with the previously known ORF (that is, the CDS) of mRNAs and in various transcripts that were previously thought to be non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), intergenic and antisense transcripts.(2014 emerging evidence for functional peptides encoded by small open readingframes) In 2011 Altorf\u2019s were systematically categorized in Haltorf, a database, and investigations showed that a number of these Altorf\u2019s were translated. The respective altprot\u2019s also seemed conserved between species. Together with some examples the work by Xavier Roucou et al clearly illustrated a function for some of these altorf\u2019s.","title":"The story of altorf"},{"location":"contents/the%20story%20of%20drips/","text":"The story of DRiP\u2019s\\ In 1996 Jon Yewdell started to describe the role of non-canonical translation products in immunology.[1] The authors coined the term Defective Ribosomal initiation Product or DriP\u2019s and posed the question \u201cAre DRiP\u2019s a major source of antigenic peptides for Major Histocompatibility Class I molecules?\u201d The term DRiPs was used to describe a source of nascent polypeptides, highly unstable in nature exhibiting half-lives in the order of minutes and capable of producing MHC-I antigenic peptides. Such peptides are preferentially degraded due to their instability and biogenesis\u2014including alterations in translation, ribosomal modifications and post-translational mechanisms including their rapid degradation and channeling.[2] Ribosomal initiation is the first step in the process of protein synthesis, and involves the binding of ribosomes to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which contain the instructions for building proteins. Defective ribosomal initiation products are proteins that are synthesized incorrectly due to problems with the ribosomal initiation process. Defective ribosomal initiation products can be caused by a variety of factors, including mutations in the mRNA or ribosomal RNA (rRNA), defects in the ribosomal proteins, or the presence of inhibitory factors that interfere with the ribosomal initiation process. These defects can lead to the synthesis of abnormal proteins that are either non-functional or have reduced function, which can have a variety of negative effects on cellular function. There is a growing body of research on defective ribosomal initiation products and their potential roles in various diseases. For example, defects in ribosomal initiation have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as cancer and other diseases. Yewdell et al. proposed that especially in immunological processing of peptides these DRiPs may be generated in the cytosol and/or nucleus via a mechanism that enables bypassing the law of mass action for conversion of the degradome to the immunopeptidome. The DRiP hypothesis was proposed to explain kinetic observations that conflicted with the ruling concept that class I peptide ligands derive from the regular turnover of source proteins according the canonical routes of proteasome and endoplasmatic reticulum mediated antigen presentation. The consequence of a biased immunopeptidome is that the expression level of a protein or peptide is not necessarily the key variable to generate a immunopeptide. This becomes relevant when one realizes the immune system needs to be able to detect and respond to foreign peptides in a sea of common household proteins and peptides present in the body.

It was proposed that translational errors represent a major potential source of antigenic peptides to which central immune tolerance is lacking. Within the human insulin mRNA, two putative downstream translation initiation sites with strong Kozak consensus sequences are located at positions 72 and 341. Leaky ribosome scanning for translation initiation at a downstream AUG can generate out-of-frame translation products. The authors propose in the nature article that one of this alternative reading frames creates a nonsense peptide which has been referred to as \u201cinsDRiP\u201d. The authors present this as the first evidence of a naturally processed and presented immunogenic epitope, derived from an alternative open reading frame in the Insulin gene which is shown to result in the destruction of human beta cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells specifically targeted towards this \u201cinsDRiP\u201d neoepitope. The authors claim this neoantigen can be therapeutically suppressed by Crispr-cas based gene therapeutic approaches and patented the sequence. Up till now the follow up on the discovery of InsDRiP did not yet the therapeutic arena but the validation of the role of DRiP\u2019s and alternative open reading expression is laying the fundaments for a completely new type of disease mechanism(CHECK this) that may have broad implications for a better understanding of autoimmune diseases. One of the attractive elements of the proposed mechanism of \u201cinsDRiP\u201d is that the authors did not require the elusive term \u201cimmunoribosomes\u201d but rather explain the insDRiP expression as a ribosomal \u201ccrowding effect\u201d resulting in a neoepitope with devastating effects is some patients.","title":"the story of insDRiP"},{"location":"contents/the%20story%20of%20neoantigen/","text":"The story of Neoantigens Neoantigens are defined as \u201cA new protein that forms on cancer cells when certain mutations occur in tumor DNA.\u201d Neoantigens may play an important role in helping the body make an immune response against cancer cells. Neoantigens used in vaccines and other types of immunotherapy are being studied in the treatment of many types of cancer4. Neoepitopes, the antigenic determinating peptides in neoantigens, are a class of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) bounded peptides. Both neoantigens and neoepitopes can be generated according different mechanisms. Besides classical DNA mutations also frameshift translation, protein splicing or a variety of posttranslational modifications are examples found in literature. The exact first arrival of the term \u201cneoantigen\u201d is not clear but experiments with genetically identical mice and tumor injections first hinted that, for the host immune system, new antigenic specificity may exist for tumors. The first report mentioning the term neoantigen dates back to 1996 where the term was used by Thierry Boon et al. The evidence for the concept of neoantigens came from the early experiments George and Eva Klein (1960). Using inbred syngeneic mice, and the tumors that can be chemically induced in them, these early reports noted that mice could be immunized against syngeneic tumors and rendered resistant to them by such immunization. Remarkably, each individual tumor elicited immunity only against itself, and not against any other tumor of the same type, induced in the same fashion even when large panels of tumors were tested. After 1996 it still took several years before the concept of neoantigens was understood better and their existence was unambiguously shown by mass spectrometry around 2016.","title":"The story of neoantigen"},{"location":"contents/the%20story%20of%20nested%20orfs/","text":"Nested alternate open reading frames (nested AORFs) are a type of genetic sequence that can encode multiple proteins from a single gene. They are called \"nested\" because the open reading frames (ORFs) are located within one another, and \"alternate\" because they can produce different proteins depending on which ORF is used for translation. These sequences are thought to play a role in gene regulation and protein diversity, and have been found in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. In a nested AORF, multiple ORFs are found within a single gene, and each ORF can potentially be transcribed and translated into a different protein. The use of nested AORFs is thought to be an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and producing protein diversity. For example, the use of different ORFs within a single gene can allow for the production of multiple proteins with different functions or regulatory roles. Additionally, the choice of which ORF is used for translation can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of specific regulatory elements or the availability of certain proteins or small RNA molecules. One notable example of nested AORFs is the N-Myc gene in mammals. This gene has multiple ORFs that can produce proteins with different functions, including NCYM, a cis antisense encoded factor that regulates the expression of other genes.12 Mutations in the N-Myc gene have been associated with various types of cancer, and the use of different ORFs within the gene has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of these diseases.","title":"The story of nested orfs"},{"location":"contents/the%20story%20of%20peptons/","text":"The story of peptons In 1989 Boon and van Pel proposed an hypothesis; \u201cT cell-recognized antigenic peptides derived from the cellular genome are not protein degradation products but can be generated directly by transcription and translation of short subgenic regions\u201d. 2 The authors observed unexpected antigenicity in their experiments with mutated tumor cell-lines in mice and proposed that short genetic regions located around a sequence coding for the antigenic peptide can be transcribed autonomously. These regions, hereafter called peptons, would have a length of a few hundred basepairs, thereby exceeding only by a small factor that of the sequence coding for the peptide. The pepton hypothesis states that all peptons are expressed in all tissues. After some initial articles the pepton hypothesis was not broadly investigated, irrespective of the highly esteemed research by Thierry Boon and his coworkers. The concept of peptons seemed to focus on transcription which did not yield a workable theory to explain the pepton observations sufficiently and after a couple articles we can see a follow up in the concept by suggestion of a new mechanism; Defective Ribosomal initiation Products (DRiP\u2019s) which focuses more on translation. The DRiP theory takes into account a mismatch between protein turnover rates of stable viral proteins (slow, days) and the response to viral infection (fast, hours).","title":"The story of peptons"}]}
