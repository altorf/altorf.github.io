Introduction
The acquisition of the DNA sequence of human genome was a landmark in biotechnology in 2001.1
However, after over 20 years for the analysis and application of the human genome information in
clinical settings still we have many riddles to unravel. Limitations in research tools for gene
transcription, translation and the bioinformatics to assess exactly how DNA sequences are
transcribed, translated and affect the phenotype obstructed the optimal use of genome sequences.
In addition there still are many poorly understood aspects of processing of peptides and proteins
which hamper the true applicability of the human genome sequence information.

For many diseases the associated immunology is a key field to understand better. However, the
comprehensive analysis of the immunopeptidome, a critical component for understanding the
immune system, still lags behind the genomic information. In this review the immunopeptidome is
defined as the set of peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI)
molecules. The immunopeptidome, defined as the repertoire of all peptides presented by MHC class I
molecules in a given set of cells, can be determined empirically by mass spectrometry or
computationally by applying algorithms for peptide binding to the set of MHC allomorphs expressed
by the cell. Exact knowledge of the role of the immunopeptidome in health and disease, in relation
to the genome information, can directly fuel and guide the development of next-generation
vaccines, novel cell therapies and immunotherapies against autoimmunity, infectious diseases and
cancers.

Especially the part of the immunopeptidome comprising the MHCI antigenic peptides has been an
intense area of research the last decade due to the new possibilities of high throughput ribosome
profiling, mass pectrometry and next generation sequencing allowing to investigate translation in an

unbiased manner. Although the immunopeptidome and especially the MHCI peptides can be derived
from the degradation of proteins that are present in a cell, they can also be generated directly by
transcription and translation of short regions within the cellular transcriptome. This process, called
non canonical translation, involves the transcription of a short stretch of DNA and translation of that
short stretch of RNA into a short peptide, which is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and loaded onto an MHC molecule. The MHC-peptide complex is then transported to the surface
of the cell, where it can be recognized by T cells. This process allows T cells to recognize and respond
to specific proteins that are being produced within a cell, rather than just those that are present as
degradation products. It has proven to be an important mechanism for the immune system to
monitor the activity of cells and to identify and respond to cells that are producing abnormal or
potentially harmful proteins (REFS).

In this review we explore the field of so-called non-canonical translation products in relation to
disease and immunological processes. The human genome with its 3 billion base pairs has a large
capacity of potential translation products and only part of the coding capacity seems to be explored
with respect to the role of non-canonical translation. What is the total number of peptides if take
into account all reading frames on both strands and directions? Which ones are transcribed and
expressed? How do cells deal with translational “noise”. i.e. nonsense (m)RNA’s and their
subsequent translation? Which peptides are recognized and selected in the immune system? Is only
a small subset of the total genome functionally expressed or are there large amounts of open reading
frames present but never expressed ? At least according the classical meaning of expression in terms
of an biochemical activity or is a subset of peptides mainly important for immunological processes?

Potentially immunogenic alternative open reading frame products can be discovered under different
names in literature. The list of similar or overlapping terms coined to refer to these peptides is long
and due to the relative freshness of the observations the list is getting long and somewhat
confusing. In this review will provide a framework to classify the different types of orfs and their
translation products. We also describe the mechanistic background of these non canonical orf’s or
alternative orf’s. In various paragraphs we will deal in a chronological overview with the first
discovery of alternative Open Reading Frame products (altORF) or the many related terms: Peptons,
Neoantigens, Micropeptides, Small Open Reading Frame (smORF), Cryptic peptides, Defective
ribosomal initiation products (DRiP), Non-canonical translation products, micro Open Reading Frame
(mORF), non-canonical HLA-binding peptides (noncHLAp), antisense proteins, ghost proteins. These
proteins and peptides can be generated by a variety of separate mechanisms for example by both
programmed and non-programmed frameshifting, internal ribosome entry sites, and repeat
associated non ATG translation. The summary of the various terms and classification of several types
of non-canonical translation mechanisms may be helpful to design better diagnostics, therapies and
vaccines.
