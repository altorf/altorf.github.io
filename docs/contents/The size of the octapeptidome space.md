Introduction
The size of the peptidome sequence space, or the total of all possible combinations of  a peptide of N aminoacids is huge.  In order to estimate the size of the entire peptidome search space in relation to the total of potential MHCI peptides in the human genome we created a custom total translation of the human genome into octapeptides. To get a better grip on exploration of this human octapeptidome space, or all the genomic encoded octapeptides  we performed an in silico translation for the reference human genome GRCh38. Hypothetically all of these octapeptides can be transcribed and translated as the recent discoveries in the field of of non-canonical translation drastically increased the amount of potential peptides being expressed and discovered in  the MHCI peptidome. These cryptic MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences.1

Most sequences in sequence space presumably have no function, leaving relatively small regions that are populated by naturally occurring genes. However the absence of a function may also be an interesting feature if the presumably functionless peptide encoded in the genome is expressed under upset or unusual conditions and sufficiently high enough to processed in the immune system.

A typical estimate of the size of entire peptidome sequence space is 20100 (approx. 10130) for a protein of 100 amino acids in which any of the normally occurring 20 amino acids can be found. 2
Since MHCI  is restricting our search to a defined length for peptides to 8 amino acids we will limit our calculations to peptides of 8 aa or simply 24 Nucleotides. For simplicity we also ignore post translational modifications and only assume the 20 amino acids used in normal translation.  The total number of possible peptides for this octapeptidome is 208 = 25.600.000.000 peptides. This number of 25.6 billion Octapeptides is referred to a the total octapeptidome.   For the human Genome we have determined the total number of possible peptides by using the latest  update; GRCh38.p14, 3634521541 unique octaptptides are generated  bij insilico translation of all possible reading frames and strands
