Cryptic peptides are referring to a diverse group of peptides which come to existence by probably various mechanisms.  In this review we investigate the literature considering the cryptic peptide  in reference to their role in the  Immune system. Cytolytic T cells eliminate infected or cancer cells by recognizing peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. The antigenic peptides are derived primarily from newly synthesized proteins including those produced by cryptic translation mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that cryptic translation can be initiated by distinct mechanisms at non-AUG codons in addition to conventional translation initiated at the canonical AUG start codon.
