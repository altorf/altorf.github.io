The story of altORF’s
An alternative open reading frame (altORF) is a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule that can be translated into a protein, similar to the main ORF in a gene. AltORFs can originate from a diverse array of  mechanisms. For example near cognate start codons can create alternative translation initiation sites initiating protein synthesis at a different location than the main ORF. Alternative ORFs are often found in the non-coding regions of a genome, and their expression may be regulated differently than the main ORF.
Alternative ORFs are important because they can give rise to either diverse protein isoforms, or totally different proteins which can have different functions in the cell. For example, alternative ORFs may produce proteins with different amino acid sequences, post-translational modifications, or subcellular localization. Alternative ORFs may also play a role in gene expression regulation, as they can be subject to different transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms.
Several methods have been developed to identify alternative ORFs, including computational analysis of genomic sequences, ribosome profiling which involves high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments. These approaches have revealed that alternative ORFs are more common than previously thought, and they may contribute to the diversity and complexity of proteomes in various organisms.
In summary, alternative ORFs are sequences in DNA or RNA that can be translated into proteins, and they may give rise to diverse protein isoforms with different functions. They are important in gene expression regulation and proteome diversity, and their identification has been facilitated by various computational and experimental techniques.  
Many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain, in addition to a reference open reading frame (ORF), unconventional alternative open reading frames (altORF). Here, altORFs are defined as potential protein-coding ORFs in ncRNAs, in UTRs or in different reading frames from annotated CDSs in mRNAs (Figure 1a). For clarity, predicted proteins translated from altORFs are termed alternative proteins (altPROT’s) and proteins translated from annotated CDSs are termed reference proteins.7  The processes ( scan trough, read through, an internal ribosome entry) inducing AltProt synthesis can be associated with translation stress e.g. due to infection, oncogenesis or unknown factors affecting ribosomal function and performance.

The additional coding sequences can vary in size from few, below 100 (small open reading frames; sORFs),  to several hundred codons and can be located upstream, downstream or even overlapping with the reference ORF.9 Translation of these altORFs occurs from different translation initiation sites and may happen in a different reading frame as the reference ORF. The presence of small open reading frames is not restricted to mRNA but has been also described for other regulatory RNAs which were formerly believed to be non-coding (ncRNA, (Nam et al., 2016)). A number of long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to encode for and extensively translate small peptides.10 11 
A translatable ORF is typically recognized as the coding DNA sequence (CDS) on an mRNA that gives rise to its principle protein product. sORFs are distinguished from all other ORFs by their sizes, but not all sORFs are translated or are indeed translatable. Translatable sORFs have been found within the 5ʹ leader and 3ʹ trailer sequences, within or overlapping with the previously known ORF (that is, the CDS) of mRNAs and in various transcripts that were previously thought to be non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), intergenic and antisense transcripts.(2014 emerging evidence for functional peptides encoded by small open readingframes)
In 2011 Altorf’s were systematically categorized in Haltorf, a database, and investigations showed that  a number of these Altorf’s were translated. The respective altprot’s also seemed conserved between species.  Together with some examples the work by Xavier Roucou et al clearly illustrated a function for some of these altorf’s.
