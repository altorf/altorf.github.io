The story of non-canonical protein expression
Up to 2014 non-canonical translation was deemed insignificant and marginally important for biotechnological applications. But the introduction of ribosome profiling in combination with next generation sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry advances provided convincing  evidence and opened up a higher interest into research on the role of small and non-canonical ORF’s in biology.  In 2009 Ingolia et al showed that in yeast a significant amount of small orf’s and non-canonical expression products were detectable13. In follow up studies several alternative orfeome databases were used and many of the observed non-canonical translated products were detected with advanced mass spectrometry once the databases for analysis of the data were expanded with non-canonical peptide sequences. And in addition to yeast, improved bioinformatics, ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry resulted in the observation of many new peptides, also in other species. Here we focus on the immunological aspects of these observations as sequencing of MHC associated peptides (MAP’s) confirmed that a  relevant number of these peptides seem to originate from non-canonical gene expression. Non-canonical MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences.
