The story of Neoantigens
Neoantigens are defined as  “A new protein that forms on cancer cells when certain mutations occur in tumor DNA.” Neoantigens may play an important role in helping the body make an immune response against cancer cells. Neoantigens used in vaccines and other types of immunotherapy are being studied in the treatment of many types of cancer4. Neoepitopes, the antigenic determinating peptides in neoantigens, are a class of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) bounded peptides. Both neoantigens and neoepitopes can be generated according different mechanisms. Besides classical DNA mutations also frameshift translation, protein splicing or a variety of posttranslational modifications are examples found in literature.  
The exact first arrival of the term “neoantigen” is not clear but experiments with genetically identical mice and tumor injections first hinted that, for the host immune system, new antigenic specificity may exist for tumors. The first report mentioning the term neoantigen dates back to 1996 where the term was used by Thierry Boon et al. The evidence for the concept of neoantigens came from the early experiments George and Eva Klein (1960). Using inbred syngeneic mice, and the tumors that can be chemically induced in them, these early reports noted that mice could be immunized against syngeneic tumors and rendered resistant to them by such immunization. Remarkably, each individual tumor elicited immunity only against itself, and not against any other tumor of the same type, induced in the same fashion even when large panels of tumors were tested. After 1996 it still took several years before the concept of neoantigens was understood better and their existence was unambiguously shown by mass spectrometry around 2016.
