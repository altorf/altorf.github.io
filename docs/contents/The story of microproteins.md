Roughly 25,000 genes code for biologically relevant proteins, most of which are large chains of 300 or more linked amino acids. But, increasingly, “microproteins,” with fewer than 100 amino acids, are being found to have important roles in health and disease. Despite their small size, microproteins play important roles in a variety of biological processes, including gene regulation, cell signaling, and protein folding. Microproteins have been observed to be highly conserved over long evolutionary times in animals and in plants but they can also be evolutionarily novel.  This can be leveraged when human microproteins translated from noncanonical ORFs are used to look for evolutionary birth events. More specifically, to identify and examine cases in the human lineage of small proteins that evolved out of previously noncoding sequences and acquired function either immediately or shortly thereafter. This is doubly important: for our understanding of the intriguing, and still largely mysterious phenomenon of de novo gene birth, but also for our appreciation of the full functional potential of the human genome and finding out is the MHCI class of peptides can be connected to the microproteins.
