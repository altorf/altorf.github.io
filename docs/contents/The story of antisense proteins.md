Antisense proteins are defined by the opposite DNA strand they originate from,  they are; until now mainly described for viral, canonical genes. From the time of their discovery, it was thought that retroviruses encoded proteins on only one strand of proviral DNA. However, in 1988, it was predicted that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and other retroviruses, express an antisense protein encoded on the DNA strand opposite that encoding the known viral proteins.14   
Since most genomes has been proven to be riddled with retroviral remnants and transposons we assume that this mechanism of antisense proteins being expressed and functional may also be valid for  cellular transcription and translation. This results in the notion that, particularly in upset conditions like cancer, stress or viral infections, there is a possibility that not only antisense genes are transcribed and translated but also random antisense transcripts start to appear, accumulate and contribute to the appearance of novel antigens triggering an immune response. Antisense proteins differ from Alternative Open reading frame products as the antisense proteins derive from the antisense RNA while alt prots derive from “normal”” mRNA’s due to frameshift’s, alternative star codons or splicevariants of normal mRNA.
