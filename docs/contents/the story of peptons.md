The story of peptons
In 1989 Boon and van Pel proposed an hypothesis; “T cell-recognized antigenic peptides derived from the cellular genome are not protein degradation products but can be generated directly by transcription and translation of short subgenic regions”. 2 The authors observed unexpected antigenicity in their experiments with mutated tumor cell-lines in mice and proposed that short genetic regions located around a sequence coding for the antigenic peptide can be transcribed autonomously. These regions, hereafter called peptons, would have a length of a few hundred basepairs, thereby exceeding only by a small factor that of the sequence coding for the peptide. The pepton hypothesis states that all peptons are expressed in all tissues. After some initial articles the pepton hypothesis was not broadly investigated, irrespective of the highly esteemed research by Thierry Boon and his coworkers.  The concept of peptons seemed to focus on transcription which did not yield a workable theory to explain the pepton observations sufficiently and after a couple articles we can see a follow up in the concept by suggestion of a new mechanism; Defective Ribosomal initiation Products (DRiP’s) which focuses more on translation. The DRiP theory takes into account a mismatch between protein turnover rates of stable viral proteins (slow, days) and the response to viral infection (fast, hours).
