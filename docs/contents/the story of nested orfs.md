Nested alternate open reading frames (nested AORFs) are a type of genetic sequence that can encode multiple proteins from a single gene. They are called "nested" because the open reading frames (ORFs) are located within one another, and "alternate" because they can produce different proteins depending on which ORF is used for translation. These sequences are thought to play a role in gene regulation and protein diversity, and have been found in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. In a nested AORF, multiple ORFs are found within a single gene, and each ORF can potentially be transcribed and translated into a different protein. The use of nested AORFs is thought to be an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and producing protein diversity. For example, the use of different ORFs within a single gene can allow for the production of multiple proteins with different functions or regulatory roles. Additionally, the choice of which ORF is used for translation can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of specific regulatory elements or the availability of certain proteins or small RNA molecules. 
One notable example of nested AORFs is the N-Myc gene in mammals. This gene has multiple ORFs that can produce proteins with different functions, including NCYM, a cis antisense encoded factor that regulates the expression of other genes.12 Mutations in the N-Myc gene have been associated with various types of cancer, and the use of different ORFs within the gene has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of these diseases.
