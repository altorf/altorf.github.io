Topic: A systematic current overview of human antigens originating from both canonical and non-
canonical translation processes with significance for medical applications.
The working hypothesis is: “Any peptide encoded in host cells and expressed during distress may be a
potential target for a diagnostic, therapeutic or vaccine design. Irrespective whether this peptide has
a proven functionality and independent whether derived from a canonical or non-canonical process”.

“The theoretical number of all possible peptides by far exceeds the number of functional peptides
encoded and translated in the currently identified and described peptidome. An identifiable
collection of genomic encoded peptides, expressed due to erroneous translation during a disease
state can be used as therapeutic or diagnostic targets.”
