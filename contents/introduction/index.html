<p>Introduction
The acquisition of the DNA sequence of human genome was a landmark in biotechnology in 2001.1 However, after over 20 years for the analysis and application of the human genome information in clinical settings still we have many riddles to unravel. Limitations research tools for gene transcription, translation and the bioinformatics to assess exactly how DNA sequences are transcribed, translated and affect the phenotype obstructed the optimal use of genome sequences. In addition there still are many poorly understood aspects of processing of peptides and proteins which hamper the true applicability of the human genome sequence information.</p>
<p>For many diseases the associated immunology is a key field to understand better. However, the comprehensive analysis of the immunopeptidome, a critical component for understanding the immune system, still lags behind the genomic information. In this review the immunopeptidome is defined as the set of peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI) molecules. Exact knowledge of the role of the immunopeptidome in health and disease,  in relation to the  genome information, can directly fuel and guide the development of next-generation vaccines, novel cell therapies and immunotherapies against autoimmunity, infectious diseases and cancers.</p>
<p>Especially the part of the immunopeptidome comprising the MHCI antigenic peptides has been an intense area of research the last decade due to the new possibilities of high throughput ribosome profiling, mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing allowing to investigate translation in an unbiased manner. Although the immunopeptidome and especially the MHCI peptides can be derived from the degradation of proteins that are present in a cell, they can also be generated directly by transcription and translation of short regions within the cellular transcriptome. This process, called non canonical translation, involves the transcription of a short stretch of DNA and translation of that short stretch of RNA into a short peptide, which is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and loaded onto an MHC molecule. The MHC-peptide complex is then transported to the surface of the cell, where it can be recognized by T cells. This process allows T cells to recognize and respond to specific proteins that are being produced within a cell, rather than just those that are present as degradation products. It has proven to be an important mechanism for the immune system to monitor the activity of cells and to identify and respond to cells that are producing abnormal or potentially harmful proteins (REFS).</p>
<p>In this review we explore the field of so-called non-canonical translation products in relation to disease and immunological processes. The human genome with its 3 billion base pairs has a large capacity of potential translation products and only part of the coding capacity seems to be explored with respect to  the role of non-canonical translation. What is the total number of peptides if take into account all reading frames on both strands and directions? Which ones are transcribed and expressed? How do cells deal with translational “noise”. i.e. nonsense (m)RNA’s and their subsequent translation? Which peptides are recognized and selected in the immune system? Is only a small subset of the total genome functionally expressed or are there large amounts of open reading frames present but never expressed  ? At least according the classical meaning of expression in terms of an biochemical activity or is a subset of peptides mainly important for immunological processes?</p>
<p>Potentially immunogenic alternative open reading frame products can be discovered under different names in literature. The list of similar or overlapping terms coined to refer to these peptides is long and due to the relative freshness of the observations the list is  getting long and somewhat confusing. In this review will provide a framework to classify the different types of orfs and their translation products. We also describe the mechanistic background of these  non-canonical orf’s or alternative orf’s. In various paragraphs we will deal in a chronological overview with the first discovery of alternative Open Reading Frame products (altORF) or the many related terms: Peptons, Neoantigens, Micropeptides, Small Open Reading Frame (smORF), Cryptic peptides, Defective ribosomal initiation products (DRiP), Non-canonical translation products, micro Open Reading Frame (mORF), non-canonical HLA-binding peptides (noncHLAp), antisense proteins, ghost proteins. These proteins and peptides can be generated by a variety of separate mechanisms for example by both programmed and non-programmed frameshifting, internal ribosome entry sites, and repeat associated non ATG translation. The summary of the various terms and classification of several types of non-canonical translation mechanisms may be helpful to design better diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.</p>
<p>The story of PAMPs and DAMPs: What’s the difference?
PAMP stands for "pathogen-associated molecular pattern." It is a molecule that is associated with a pathogen and is recognized by the host's immune system. PAMPs are typically found on the surface of pathogens, and they are used by the immune system to identify the presence of an invading pathogen.
DAMP stands for "damage-associated molecular pattern." It is a molecule that is released by damaged cells in response to injury or stress. DAMPs are recognized by the immune system and can trigger an immune response. They are involved in the body's natural response to injury or tissue damage, and they play a role in the inflammatory response.
Both PAMPs and DAMPs are important for the immune system to function properly. PAMPs help the immune system to recognize and respond to pathogens, while DAMPs help the immune system to recognize and respond to tissue damage or injury.PAMPS and DAMPS are a special class of immunomodulation molecules. PAMPs are molecules derived from microorganisms and thus drive inflammation in response to infections. One well-known PAMP is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is found on the outer cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. 
DAMPs are immune response modulating molecules derived from host cells, including tumor cells, dead or dying cells, or products released from cells in response to signals such as hypoxia or stress.6 Because DAMP’s are derived from host materials, DAMPs can induce what’s known as sterile inflammatory responses where no infection is involved in triggering the inflammatory responses. DAMPs are intracellularly sequestered molecules that remain unrecognized by the immune system under normal physiological conditions.
In this review neoepitopes are not considered as a special class of DAMP’s because neoepitopes are de novo generated in abnormal physiological conditions like infection, cancer or stress.  Neoantigens due to the presentation by MHCI molecules are thus a class of molecules that must be separated from DAMP’s.  </p>
<p>The story of Nested alternate open reading frames
Nested alternate open reading frames (nested AORFs) are a type of genetic sequence that can encode multiple proteins from a single gene. They are called "nested" because the open reading frames (ORFs) are located within one another, and "alternate" because they can produce different proteins depending on which ORF is used for translation. These sequences are thought to play a role in gene regulation and protein diversity, and have been found in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. In a nested AORF, multiple ORFs are found within a single gene, and each ORF can potentially be transcribed and translated into a different protein. The use of nested AORFs is thought to be an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and producing protein diversity. For example, the use of different ORFs within a single gene can allow for the production of multiple proteins with different functions or regulatory roles. Additionally, the choice of which ORF is used for translation can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of specific regulatory elements or the availability of certain proteins or small RNA molecules. 
One notable example of nested AORFs is the N-Myc gene in mammals. This gene has multiple ORFs that can produce proteins with different functions, including NCYM, a cis antisense encoded factor that regulates the expression of other genes.12 Mutations in the N-Myc gene have been associated with various types of cancer, and the use of different ORFs within the gene has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of these diseases. 
The story of microproteins<br />
Roughly 25,000 genes code for biologically relevant proteins, most of which are large chains of 300 or more linked amino acids. But, increasingly, “microproteins,” with fewer than 100 amino acids, are being found to have important roles in health and disease. Despite their small size, microproteins play important roles in a variety of biological processes, including gene regulation, cell signaling, and protein folding. Microproteins have been observed to be highly conserved over long evolutionary times in animals and in plants but they can also be evolutionarily novel.  This can be leveraged when human microproteins translated from noncanonical ORFs are used to look for evolutionary birth events. More specifically, to identify and examine cases in the human lineage of small proteins that evolved out of previously noncoding sequences and acquired function either immediately or shortly thereafter. This is doubly important: for our understanding of the intriguing, and still largely mysterious phenomenon of de novo gene birth, but also for our appreciation of the full functional potential of the human genome and finding out is the MHCI class of peptides can be connected to the microproteins.</p>
<p>The story of non-canonical protein expression
Up to 2014 non-canonical translation was deemed insignificant and marginally important for biotechnological applications. But the introduction of ribosome profiling in combination with next generation sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry advances provided convincing  evidence and opened up a higher interest into research on the role of small and non-canonical ORF’s in biology.  In 2009 Ingolia et al showed that in yeast a significant amount of small orf’s and non-canonical expression products were detectable13. In follow up studies several alternative orfeome databases were used and many of the observed non-canonical translated products were detected with advanced mass spectrometry once the databases for analysis of the data were expanded with non-canonical peptide sequences. And in addition to yeast, improved bioinformatics, ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry resulted in the observation of many new peptides, also in other species. Here we focus on the immunological aspects of these observations as sequencing of MHC associated peptides (MAP’s) confirmed that a  relevant number of these peptides seem to originate from non-canonical gene expression. Non-canonical MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences.</p>
<p>The story of ghost peptides
The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) proteins play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting peptides to T cells, allowing the immune system to recognize and respond to foreign or abnormal cells. These MHCI peptides are derived from the degradation of proteins within the cell, and they are typically generated through the action of proteasomes, which are responsible for breaking down proteins into smaller peptides. However, there is a class of MHCI peptides known as "ghost" peptides that do not originate from the degradation of proteins within the cell. Instead, these ghost peptides are derived from the degradation of RNA molecules, which are transcribed from the DNA within the cell's genome. These ghost peptides can be presented to T cells in the same way as regular MHCI peptides, and they can trigger an immune response in a similar manner. The role of ghost proteins in the immune system is not well understood, and there is still much research being done to determine their exact function. Some studies have suggested that ghost peptides may play a role in the development of autoimmune disorders, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. Other studies have suggested that ghost peptides may be involved in the development of cancer, as they may be able to stimulate an immune response against abnormal cells. Despite the potential importance of ghost peptides in the immune system, much more research is needed to fully understand their role and how they may be used in the development of new treatments for immune disorders and diseases. However, it is clear that ghost peptides are an important component of the immune system, and they may hold the key to unlocking new and innovative approaches to fighting a wide range of diseases.</p>
<p>The story of antisense proteins
Antisense proteins are defined by the opposite DNA strand they originate from,  they are; until now mainly described for viral, canonical genes. From the time of their discovery, it was thought that retroviruses encoded proteins on only one strand of proviral DNA. However, in 1988, it was predicted that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and other retroviruses, express an antisense protein encoded on the DNA strand opposite that encoding the known viral proteins.14 <br />
Since most genomes has been proven to be riddled with retroviral remnants and transposons we assume that this mechanism of antisense proteins being expressed and functional may also be valid for  cellular transcription and translation. This results in the notion that, particularly in upset conditions like cancer, stress or viral infections, there is a possibility that not only antisense genes are transcribed and translated but also random antisense transcripts start to appear, accumulate and contribute to the appearance of novel antigens triggering an immune response. Antisense proteins differ from Alternative Open reading frame products as the antisense proteins derive from the antisense RNA while alt prots derive from “normal”” mRNA’s due to frameshift’s, alternative star codons or splicevariants of normal mRNA. 
The story of cryptic peptides
Cryptic peptides are referring to a diverse group of peptides which come to existence by probably various mechanisms.  In this review we investigate the literature considering the cryptic peptide  in reference to their role in the  Immune system. Cytolytic T cells eliminate infected or cancer cells by recognizing peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. The antigenic peptides are derived primarily from newly synthesized proteins including those produced by cryptic translation mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that cryptic translation can be initiated by distinct mechanisms at non-AUG codons in addition to conventional translation initiated at the canonical AUG start codon.
The dark proteome and MHCI class peptides
The dark proteome refers to the vast majority of proteins in an organism that are not easily detected using standard techniques such as mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis. These proteins may be present at low levels, may be highly dynamic or transient, or may have structural properties that make them difficult to detect. Despite their elusive nature, the dark proteome is thought to play important roles in many biological processes, including cell signaling, immune defense, and metabolism. One class of proteins that has garnered particular interest within the context of the dark proteome is the MHC class I (MHCI) peptides. MHCI proteins are integral components of the immune system, playing a critical role in the recognition and presentation of foreign or abnormal proteins to immune cells. MHCI proteins are expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells and present short peptides, derived from inside the cell, to T cells, which can then mount an immune response if the peptides are deemed to be a threat. However, the vast majority of MHCI peptides are derived from the dark proteome, rather than from known proteins or protein-coding genes. This has led to the hypothesis that the dark proteome may play a significant role in immune surveillance and defense. For example, it is thought that the MHCI pathway may allow cells to present and target proteins that are produced by viruses or other pathogens, helping to protect the organism from infection. There is also evidence that MHCI peptides derived from the dark proteome may be involved in other biological processes beyond immune defense. For example, some studies have suggested that MHCI peptides may play a role in the regulation of gene expression, or may be involved in the development and function of the nervous system. Despite the potential importance of the dark proteome and MHCI peptides, there is still much that is unknown about these proteins and their roles in biology. Advances in technologies such as mass spectrometry and proteomics are helping to shed light on the dark proteome and its role in health and disease, but much work remains to be done to fully understand this part of the proteome.
The mechanisms of translation
Classic translation theory: one gene one protein
Canonical translation has traditionally been divided into four stages: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. In the first three of these stages mechanisms resulting in  non-canonical translation events have been described. Besides alternative start codons, processes like leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry and  repeat associated non-ATG translation result in alternative reading frame proteins and peptides. During elongation both programmed and non-programmed frameshift events result in the translation of alternative reading frames into peptides. </p>
<p>The story of immunoribosomes
Ribosomes are universally important in biology and their production is dysregulated by developmental disorders, cancer, and virus infection.  The concept of specialized ribosomes, immunoribosomes, was proposed to supported the DRiP hypothesis.15 Immunoribosomes are supposed to explain the kinetic observations of early appearance of viral immune responses while viral proteins are inherently stable and retirees or degradation products seem unlikely source to rely on for a timely immune system activation. Till this moment immunoribosomes have yet to be identified and characterized, no clear evidence has been presented for their existence. </p>
